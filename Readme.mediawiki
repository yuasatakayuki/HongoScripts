== To use Suzaku Analaysis Scripts ==
Before using Suzaku Analysis Scripts such as hsSuzakuGoHXDPointSource and hsSuzakuGoXISPointSource, please set the environment variable RUBYLIB properly to include the directory where HongoScripts/ruby is installed.
When installed using Homebrew, the path should be set as follows: 
<pre>
export RUBYLIB=/usr/local/lib/ruby:$RUBYLIB
</pre>
in your shell initialization file ($HOME/.zshrc or $HOME/.bashrc). 

When installaed as a folder (i.e. without make install), set something like:
<pre>
export PATH=path_to/HongoScripts/bin:$PATH
export RUBYLIB=path_to/HongoScripts/ruby:$RUBYLIB
</pre>
