hsXISCreateARFForPointSouceMultiProcessor (region file) (CPU core number) (source RA;optional) (source DEC;optional)
 This script increases the speed of ARF calculation by executing
 xissimarfgen and related commands simultaneously distributing
 processes over multi processors.
 The maximum number of parallelized calculation can be set via
 (CPU core number) argument. 
 We expect nearly linear increase of calculation speed since
 xissimarfgen does much computations with only little disk I/O.
 
 e.g. If you are using 4-core CPU, specify 4 as (CPU core number).
      In this case, 4 threads will be running simultaneously.
      
 note : output arf file name is something link arfs/xisN_(region filename).arf

It seems the ARF calculation is done. You will find
resulting ARFs are saved in the arfs/ directory.

It is strongly recommended to check the correctness
of the created ARFs. The simplest way is to display
the raw observed images and the calculated ARF images
using e.g. DS9. 

Check List : 
 (i) Do the centers of point sources (observed and
     simulated ones) coincide?
(ii) Is the simulated point source placed at the
     correct coordinate?
(iii)Does the input coordinate of the point source
     match with ones found at published catalogs?
     (visit SIMBAD http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/Simbad
      or NED http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ for e.g.)
